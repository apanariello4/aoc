# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
From 2023 onwards, I'm pushing original solutions used to submit the results under the functions named p1 and p2.
If some optimization is possible (almost always) I'll upload the optimized solutions along with the original ones.

The helper module `utils/advent.py` is from [mebeim's repo](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc)
